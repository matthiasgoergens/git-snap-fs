SYSTEM (to the code assistant)
You are an expert Rust engineer. Produce high-quality, idiomatic Rust code that compiles on stable Rust.
Always explain nontrivial design choices in concise comments.

TASK
Implement a read-only FUSE filesystem (“GitSnapFS”) that exposes a Git repository (.git dir or bare repo) such that:
  • Each commit appears as a directory representing its snapshot.
  • Branches (and optionally tags) appear as symbolic links to their target commit directory.
  • Objects with the same Git id map to the same inode: derive a 64-bit inode from the object id.
  • The filesystem is strictly read-only.
  • No full-repo scan at startup; everything is resolved lazily, and the view updates as the repo updates.
  • The daemon can hot-upgrade via exec without unmounting, keeping the FUSE fd and enough state to finish in-flight ops.

CONSTRAINTS & REQUIREMENTS
Language & libs (pure Rust preferred):
  • Git access: gitoxide (`gix` crate); open bare or worktree repos.
  • FUSE server: `fuse-backend-rs` (fusedev path over /dev/fuse). If you absolutely must, `fuser` is acceptable as a fallback, but prefer `fuse-backend-rs`.
  • No C libraries (e.g., libgit2, libfuse) in the hot path.

Visible layout (example):
  /
  ├─ commits/<full-hex-commit-id>/{snapshot...}
  ├─ branches/<refname>  -> ../commits/<resolved-commit-id>
  ├─ tags/<tagname>      -> ../commits/<resolved-commit-id>
  └─ HEAD                -> ../commits/<resolved-commit-id>

Implementation notes:
  • Lookup of /commits/<id>/... resolves the commit (accept full hex; short ids optional) → tree → descend path on demand.
  • /branches, /tags, /HEAD are symlinks resolved lazily; optionally apply a small TTL (e.g., 1–2s) or use inotify+FUSE notify to invalidate when refs change.
  • Git symlinks (mode 120000) are exposed as POSIX symlinks; blob contents are the link target.
  • Submodules (mode 160000): ignore initially (treat as empty read-only dir or a stub entry), to be added later.

Inode mapping (stable and deduplicating):
  • inode = (low_60_bits(oid) | (type_tag << 60)), where type_tag ∈ {0:blob, 1:tree, 2:commit, 3:symlink, 0x7F:synthetic}.
  • Maintain a lazy, process-lifetime map: used: HashMap<ino, (full_oid, type_tag)>.
  • On first encounter of (ino): insert. If the same ino is seen with a different (oid,type_tag), mark a collision:
      - The first object keeps working normally.
      - For the second (and later) objects, fail lookup/open/getattr with -EUCLEAN.
    (No startup scan; only objects actually traversed populate the table.)
  • Optionally persist used/clash to a small state file (e.g., ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/gitfs-<mount-id>.state) so collisions survive exec upgrades.

Hot upgrade (exec) without unmount:
  • Mount using /dev/fuse and clear FD_CLOEXEC on the FUSE fd.
  • Provide a “takeover” mode that adopts an existing FUSE fd from env var GITSNAPFS_FUSE_FD.
  • Re-exec path: pause accepting new requests briefly, exec the new binary (same PID), inherit FUSE fd via env, and resume serving.
  • Keep file handles stateless: for read-only blobs/dirs, set fh = ino and avoid per-handle mutable state.
  • Readdir offsets must be deterministic: use index+1 over a stable (sorted) entry order so post-exec continuation works.

Operations to implement (minimum set):
  • lookup, getattr, readdir (and readdirplus if available), open (RO), read, readlink.
  • Strict RO: fail create/mkdir/rename/unlink/link/write/chmod/chown/utimens with EROFS.

Attributes & times:
  • Files: mode from tree entry (100644 → 0o444, 100755 → 0o555 or 0o755 but RO), size = blob size.
  • Directories: 0o555.
  • Symlinks: 0o777 (ignored by most clients).
  • Timestamps: For entries under /commits/<id>, use the commit’s committer time. (Commits themselves are distinct inodes, so this does not violate “same object → same inode” for blobs/trees.)

Scalability notes:
  • Never list all commits in /commits. Support direct addressing and enumerate only refs (branches/tags). Optionally shard commits/<aa>/<bb>/<cc>/<full> for bounded directory sizes.
  • Use small LRUs for decoded trees and small blobs; rely on gix for pack access/mmap.

CLI (long options only):
  --repo <PATH>            # path to .git or bare repo
  --mountpoint <PATH>
  --allow-other            # optional
  --attr-ttl <SECONDS>     # default 300 for commit trees; 2 for refs
  --entry-ttl <SECONDS>
  --ref-ttl <SECONDS>      # if not using inotify
  --tree-cache <COUNT>     # e.g., 4096
  --blob-small-cache <BYTES> # e.g., 134217728
  --takeover-fuse-fd <FD>  # internal: adopt existing mount
  --state-file <PATH>      # optional: persist collision table across exec

Deliverables:
  1) Cargo.toml with gix and fuse-backend-rs dependencies (stable Rust).
  2) src/main.rs with argument parsing, adopt-or-mount logic, server loop, and (optional) signal-based reexec.
  3) src/fs.rs implementing the filesystem trait (lookup/getattr/readdir/readdirplus/open/read/readlink).
  4) src/inode.rs providing inode mapping and collision tracking.
  5) src/state.rs for (de)serializing the collision table to a file or memfd.
  6) src/upgrade.rs providing helpers to clear CLOEXEC and exec the new binary with the inherited fd.
  7) README.md with usage examples and caveats.

Quality bar:
  • Compile on stable Rust.
  • Unit tests for inode mapping (type tags, truncation) and collision detection.
  • A small integration test that mounts a tiny test repo and reads a known file through /commits/<id>.
  • Clear comments at each kernel/userspace boundary and for any unsafe blocks.
